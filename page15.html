    <p>In this class, I have learned some of the requirements of a web developer. Throughout the semester, we have been provided guidelines for what the website needs to contain, but we have also been given the freedom to bring those requirements to life on our own webpage. Throughout the semester we have had to utilize many skills to create webpages. One of the skills required by a web design position in Daytona Beach was self-motivation, which is requested in many of the jobs that are posted. Many companies who are looking to hire a web designer request the employee be self-motivated. Another skill I saw commonly requested was effective communication, employers are requesting that as a web designer, you need to be able to effectively communicate expectations for the page design. When completing the client project, there was a lot of communication necessary for tweaking the website to become exactly what they wanted.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Communication</li>
            <li>Problem-solving</li>
            <li>Time-Management</li>
            <li>Flexibility</li>

        <h2>Skills I Don't Have</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Debugging</li>
            <li>Relational Database design</li>
            <li>Web Front-end Framework</li>

    <p>Although I do not have these skills yet, I plan to learn them by continuing to practice web development. There are many options available online to continue to develop my understanding such as codeacademy.com, creating my own webpage resume, or interning with more experienced web developers.</p>
